    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian
      teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago!
      <br />
      With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery
      coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly
      the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.
